# Step-by-step guide to implement a Swift class and consume in React Native

(As of React Native [0.26](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.26/))

In this guide, we will implement a Swift class to encrypt and decrypt a text by AES128. And the consumes the Swift class in React Native with UI.

Steps are separated into branches:
* `master` branch contains the final code
* `vanilla` branch contains the basic setup
* `step-*` branch contains result of every step

Every step has its own README.md file, you should start reading from [step 1](https://github.com/candrholdings/reactnative-crypto-demo/blob/step-1/README.md).

| Step                                                                                     | Topic                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Step 1](https://github.com/candrholdings/reactnative-crypto-demo/blob/step-1/README.md) | Creates a new Swift class |
| [Step 2](https://github.com/candrholdings/reactnative-crypto-demo/blob/step-2/README.md) | Adds a new Swift method   |
| [Step 3](https://github.com/candrholdings/reactnative-crypto-demo/blob/step-3/README.md) | Adds an encrypt method    |
| [Step 4](https://github.com/candrholdings/reactnative-crypto-demo/blob/step-4/README.md) | Adds a decrypt method     |
| [Step 5](https://github.com/candrholdings/reactnative-crypto-demo/blob/step-5/README.md) | Adds an UI form           |
